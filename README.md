    user with six choices in an endless while loop until the user chooses '0' to exit. The six choices corresponds

    and check out boolean. The following functions three return their corresponding barcode ID, title, and 
    author name. While the boolean getCheckOut function returns a boolean value of true or false corresponding to t
    he checkOut (true) and checkIn (false) functions.

    The function of the 'Library' class is to run the activities of the library such as create new library "database," 
    add books, print the current books in the library "database," remove book by barcode ID or title, and check out or 
    check in book. 

    The overall program objective is to manage a simple console based library management system where the end
    user(s) can add, remove, and see their collection of books by importing the collection of books in txt files.
